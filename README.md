### Refactoring Plan

The refactoring of widgets is nearing completion. You can try them on the "Refactored Widgets" page in the Gallery.

**Please note**:  
If you plan to start a project using PyQt-SiliconUI in the near future, it is **highly recommended to use only the widgets listed under “Refactored Widgets”**.  
The older widgets have many issues and are being gradually replaced.  

Similarly, the application templates are also under a complete overhaul. Work on them will begin once the core widget and component refactors are done.  
Since the current templates contain many flaws and have poor implementations,  
**we strongly advise against using the old application templates for real-world projects until the refactor is complete**.
